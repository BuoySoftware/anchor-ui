# Forms

In Buoy we have a lot of forms. As such we've built a set of form components
which relies on convention over configuration to streamline the building and
maintaining of forms within our system. Our form component system was built with
the Ruby gem [Simple Form] as inspiration. We have built this on top of
[react-hook-form] and it's useful to read it's documentation to understand how
React Hook Form works.


## i18n

Our library utilizes the power of [react-i18next] to do look ups for labels,
placeholders, and errors. The assumption is that these translations exist within
the namespace called 'forms' or a namespace called `anchorForms`.

```
{
  "errors": {
    "date": "Invalid date",
    "required": "This field is required",
    "radio": {
      "required": "This field is required, please make a selection"
    }
  },
  "labels": {
    "create_shipment": {
      "consignee": "Who is this shipment for?",
      "product_type": "What product type is being shipped?"
    }
  },
  "placeholders": {
    "phone_number": "ex: xxx-xxx-xxxx",
    "date_field": "ex: mm/dd/yyyy",
    "registration_address": {
      "address_1": "ex: 123 Apple Street"
    }
  }
}
```

### Default translations

AnchorUI provides some default translations for use within forms. To utilize them
you must import the translations and add them as a resource in i18next.

Example:

```javascript
import { anchorFormsEn } from "@buoysoftware/anchor-ui";

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  lng: "en",
  ns: ["anchorForms"],
  resources: {
    en: {
      anchorForms: anchorFormsEn
    }
  }
});
```
